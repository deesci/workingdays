# Working days generator
### Why do we need this script?
Its not as easy as finding fourth working day for three months, when we have to find for 60 months.

And we have to repeat this for tenth working day, and second last working day, and so on..

### Solution
When I faced this problem, I created and tested this python script. It generates series of required dates for n'th working days for specified years.

Supporting csv files are also available here.
